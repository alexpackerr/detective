Maya: Did you see how much they’re spending on the prom this year?

Jamie: Triple our budget, that’s for sure. 

Taylor: Imagine if the school gave us some of that. We’d definitely get our trip. Europe maybe? Out of Ohio at least. I’d love to spend the time with you nerds. 

Band Kid: Imagine if we crashed the show somehow! All snuck in or–something.

Taylor: Ha! That’d be something. 

Taylor: You know, I was in this class this one time…
