Marissa: Ugh, I don’t know anything about these girls, but from the pictures they all seem pretty stuck-up. 

???: You can vote for em too. Look, they’re collecting emails and everything. Seems like they want their prom to be pretty “secure.” 

Marissa: Guess they’ll have to see about that. Bet someone could have some fun with the system.

Mr.Levi: Ha, I’m afraid so. Got a better offer somewhere else. Heard they treat their teachers right there. 

Mr.Levi: It’ll be a shame to leave you kids behind, though. Incredible to see what you all can do, when you put your minds to it. 

Mr.Levi: Its time for me to go, though. Sometimes I wish I could leave the school a little “parting gift.” 

Zach: You didn’t have anything to do with this?

Mr.Levi: Look, what students do with the tools I give them is none of my business. Even if I show em some ways you can play with the school’s websites and servers. 

Mr.Levi: Be good out there!

Zach: Thanks, Taylor. You sure it wasn’t anyone in the band?

Taylor: Look, we’re not doing anything that could risk us getting our Spring Concert cancelled. Especially me. Its my last hurrah.

Zach: Interesting. 

Taylor: Keep up the work, little detective! You’ve got this.
