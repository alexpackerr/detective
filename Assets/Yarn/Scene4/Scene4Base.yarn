CHARACTERNAME: Hey, where are you? 
Samuel: Still in the classroom. Don’t feel like talking much, I guess. You can come if you need to, though.

Samuel: I can’t believe it. So many people have been bothering me today. Why? Just because I won the engineering challenge once? That doesn’t even have anything to do with “hacking” or anything they’re talking about? 

-> People bothering you about that kind of thing again?	
	Samuel:  Again? What do you mean again? This is new. This isn’t just people asking for help on homework, CHARACTERNAME
	Samuel: You know, this isn’t helping. Leave me alone.
	<<ChangeScene GameManager "Scene4main">>
-> Sorry to hear about that. 
	Samuel: Heh, thanks. I know this might be exciting to you, but it makes me nervous. People are being… weird, now that it feels like the year’s almost over.

Anonymous Messenger: I know you know who I am. 

Anonymous Messenger: The Prom court voting, I need it changed. 

Anonymous Messenger: You have no idea how much this means.

Anonymous Messenger: I just can’t at the end of the year. 

Anonymous Messenger: It's getting too big, I just want to spend the end of the year… calmly.

Samuel: I guess you’re right…
CHARACTERNAME: You know, I’ve gotten some ideas about this whole situation. I’m sure it’ll get cleared up soon.

Brent: Hey, CHARACTERNAME. What’s up?
Brent: You been alright? Today’s been pretty intense. All this drama over the prom queens, and Samantha wasn’t even there! I only  just found her now. 
<<endif>>
 
-> How is Samantha, actually?
	Brent: Oh! I found her with some of the other girls. Seemed like she was just waiting to make a dramatic entrance or something. I’m sure she’s fine. Probably just annoyed about it all. But what do I know?

Brent Was nice to see you again, [Player]. You should join us at the prom! Toss some balls around. It’ll be a good time, I’m sure. 

-> You know, what do you think about all the drama?
